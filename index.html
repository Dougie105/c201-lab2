      <p>My name is Ellen Conley.  I grew up mostly in <b>Iowa</b> living with my mom during the school year, spending summers in <b>Northern California</b> with my dad.  After high school, I moved to Seattle to go to <abbr title="University of Washington">UW</abbr>.  Back then I thought I wanted to be a doctor, so I did all of my pre-med coursework, worked in a dementia research lab at the <abbr title="Veterans Administration">VA</abbr> Hospital, and volunteered for a student-run free medical clinic.  I really loved the humanities classes I took though, so I ended up majoring in International Studies and never ended up doing much with all the math and science I took.</p>
      <p>After college, I decided to do Americorps instead of apply to medical school, and that kind of set me on a path to spend my twenties doing college access work.  After a few years of that, I felt a little stuck and regretted not pursuing a more technical career, but I hadn't taken enough math and science to do a STEM grad program.  So, I ended up doing my Master of Public Administration and found that I loved my quantitative analysis courses and that <i>I really really loved manipulating data and learning programming languages.</i> I ended up getting pretty good at <b>STATA and R</b> in grad school, and then I learned <b>SAS and SQL</b> working as a data analyst last year.</p>
      <p>As data analyst without a PhD or STEM degree though, I felt like once I became a good programmer, I'd probably plateau; and the money I was making wasn't great.  So, I'm here!  <b>My goal is to get a job as a developer or engineer at a company with a <i>feminist culture</i>, where I'll have <i>good mentors</i>, and where there could be <i>opportunities to collaborate with engineers in other STEM fields.</i></b></p>
